# greedy best-first search
# the evaluation function is f(n)=h(n), heuristic function, denoted by h(n), which estimates
# the distance to the goal node.
# 1. If the successor's heuristic is better than its parent, the successor is set at the
# front of the queue (with the parent reinserted directly behind it), and the loop restarts.
# 2. Else, the successor is inserted into the queue (in a location determined by its heuristic value).
# 3. The procedure will evaluate the remaining successors (if any) of the parent.
